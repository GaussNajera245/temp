  If you get an error like this:

	
        [Error: , Remote I/O error] {
	  errno: 121,
  	code: '',
	  syscall: 'readWord'
	}

  then you should check the MLX temperature sensor is well connected,



Also the trials folder is no longer available, you can check for them on previous commits,
inside that folder was how to check for temperature and distance separately
